## 3.01 Aim

---

*Let's create a basic workflow that will do some of the analysis steps for genetic data. We will have three samples with two files each - six files in total. These files will be processed through the below workflow, passing through three software.*

---

![rulegraph_1](./images/rulegraph_1.png)

We have paired end sequencing data for three samples `NA24631` to process in the `./data` directory. Let's have a look:

```bash
ls -lh ./data/
```

My output:

{% capture e3dot1 %}

```bash
total 13M
-rw-rw----+ 1 lkemp nesi99991 2.1M Sep 10 04:32 NA24631_1.fastq.gz
-rw-rw----+ 1 lkemp nesi99991 2.3M Sep 10 04:32 NA24631_2.fastq.gz
-rw-rw----+ 1 lkemp nesi99991 2.1M Sep 10 04:32 NA24694_1.fastq.gz

-rw-rw----+ 1 lkemp nesi99991 1.9M Sep 10 04:32 NA24695_2.fastq.gz
```

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e3dot1" content=e3dot1%}

## 3.02 Snakemake workflow file structure

Workflow file structure:

```bash
demo_workflow/
      |_______results/
      |_______workflow/
                 |_______Snakefile
```

We will create and run our workflow from the `workflow` directory send all of our file outputs/results to the `results` directory

*Read up on the best practice workflow structure [here](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html#distribution-and-reproducibility)*

Create this file structure and our main Snakefile with:

```bash
mkdir -p demo_workflow/{results,workflow}
touch demo_workflow/workflow/Snakefile
```

Now you should have the very beginnings of your Snakemake workflow in a `demo_workflow` directory. Let's have a look:

```bash
ls -lh demo_workflow/
```

My output:

{% capture e3dot2 %}

```bash
total 1.0K
drwxrws---+ 2 lkemp nesi99991 4.0K Sep 13 02:57 results
drwxrws---+ 3 lkemp nesi99991 4.0K Sep 13 02:57 workflow
```

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e3dot2" content=e3dot2%}
<br>

```bash
ls -lh demo_workflow/workflow/
```

My output:

{% capture e3dot3 %}

```bash
total 512
-rw-rw----+ 1 lkemp nesi99991    0 Sep 13 02:57 Snakefile
```

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e3dot3" content=e3dot3%}
<br>

Within the `workflow` directory (where we will create and run our workflow), we have a `Snakefile` file that will be the backbone of our workflow.

## 3.03 Run the software on the command line

First lets run the first step in our workflow ([fastqc](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)) directly on the command line to get the syntax of the command right and check what outputs files we expect to get. Knowing what files the software will output is important for Snakemake since it is a lazy "pull" based system where software/rules will only run if you tell it to create the output file. We will talk more about this later!

First make sure to have [fastqc](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) available. On NeSI, load the corresponding module

```bash
module load FastQC/0.11.9
```

See what parameters are available so we know how we want to run this software before we put it in a Snakemake workflow

```bash
fastqc --help
```

Create a test directory to put the output files

```bash
mkdir fastqc_test
```

Run fastqc directly on the command line on one of the samples

```bash
fastqc ./data/NA24631_1.fastq.gz ./data/NA24631_2.fastq.gz -o ./fastqc_test -t 2
```

My output:

{% capture e3dot4 %}

## 3.04 Create the first rule in your workflow

Let's wrap this up in a Snakemake workflow! Start with the basic structure of a Snakefile:

```diff
# target OUTPUT files for the whole workflow
rule all:
    input:

# workflow
rule my_rule:
    input:
        ""
    output:
        ""
    threads:
    shell:
        ""
```

Now add our fastqc rule, let's:

- Name the rule
- Fill in the the input fastq files from the `data` directory (*path relative to the Snakefile*)
- Fill in the output files (now you can see it's useful to know what files fastqc outputs!)
- Set the number of threads
- Write the fastqc shell command in the `shell:` section and pass the input/output variables to the shell command
- Set the final output files for the whole workflow in `rule all:`

---

The use of the word `input` in `rule all` can be confusing, but in this context, it is referring to the final *output* files of the whole workflow

---

```diff
# target OUTPUT files for the whole workflow
rule all:
    input:
+         "../results/fastqc/NA24631_1_fastqc.html",
+         "../results/fastqc/NA24631_2_fastqc.html",
+         "../results/fastqc/NA24631_1_fastqc.zip",
+         "../results/fastqc/NA24631_2_fastqc.zip"

# workflow
+ rule fastqc:
      input:
+         R1 = "../../data/NA24631_1.fastq.gz",
+         R2 = "../../data/NA24631_2.fastq.gz"
      output:
+         html = ["../results/fastqc/NA24631_1_fastqc.html", "../results/fastqc/NA24631_2_fastqc.html"],
+         zip = ["../results/fastqc/NA24631_1_fastqc.zip", "../results/fastqc/NA24631_2_fastqc.zip"]
+     threads: 2
      shell:
+         "fastqc {input.R1} {input.R2} -o ../results/fastqc/ -t {threads}"
```

When you have multiple input and output files:

- You can "name" you inputs/outputs, they can be called separately in the shell command
- Remember to use commas between multiple inputs/outputs, it's a common source of error!

Let's test the workflow! First we need to be in the `workflow` directory, where the Snakefile is

```bash
cd demo_workflow/workflow/
```

## 3.05 Dryrun

Then let's carry out a dryrun of the workflow, where no actual analysis is undertaken (fastqc is *not* run) but the overall Snakemake structure is run/validated. This is a good way to check for errors in your Snakemake workflow before actually running your workflow.

```bash
snakemake --dryrun
```

My output:

{% capture e3dot6 %}

```bash

This was a dry-run (flag -n). The order of jobs does not reflect the order of execution.
```

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e3dot6" content=e3dot6%}
<br>

The last table in the output confirms that the workflow will run one sample (`count 1`) through fastqc (`job fastqc`), with a minimum of 2 threads (min threads 2) and a maximum of 2 threads (`max threads 2`)

## 3.06 Create a DAG

We can also visualise our workflow by creating a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG). We can tell snakemake to create a DAG with the `--dag` flag, then pipe this output to the [dot software](https://graphviz.org/) and write the output to the file, `dag_1.png`

```bash
snakemake --dag | dot -Tpng > dag_1.png
```

My DAG:

{% capture e3dot7 %}

![DAG_1](./images/dag_1.png)

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e3dot7" content=e3dot7%}
<br>

Our diagram has a node for each job which are connected by edges representing dependencies

*Note. this diagram can be output to several other image formats such as svg or pdf*

## 3.07 Fullrun

Let's do a full run of our workflow (by removing the `--dryrun` flag). We will also now need to specify the maximum number of cores to use at one time with the `--cores` flag before snakemake will run

```bash
snakemake --cores 2
```

My output:

{% capture e3dot8 %}

```bash

Nothing happens, all the target files in `rule all` have already been created so Snakemake does nothing

Also, what happens if we create another directed acyclic graph (DAG) after the workflow has been run?

```bash
snakemake --dag | dot -Tpng > dag.png
```

My DAG:

{% capture e3dot12 %}

<br>

Notice our workflow 'job nodes' are now dashed lines, this indicates that their output is up to date and therefore the rule doesn't need to be run. We already have our target files!

This can be quite informative if your workflow errors out at a rule. You can visually check which rules successfully ran and which didn't.

## 3.09 Run using environment modules

fastqc worked because we loaded it in our current shell session. Let's specify the environment module for fastqc so the user of the workflow doesn't need to load it manually.

Update our rule to use it using the `envmodules:` directive

```diff
# target OUTPUT files for the whole workflow
rule all:
    input:
        "../results/fastqc/NA24631_1_fastqc.html",
        "../results/fastqc/NA24631_2_fastqc.html",

Notice it now says that "Activating environment modules: FastQC/0.11.9". Now the software our workflow uses will be automatically loaded!

## 3.10 Capture our logs

So far our logs (for fastqc) have been simply printed to our screen. As you can imagine, if you had a large automated workflow (that you might not be sitting at the computer watching run) you'll want to capture all that information. Therefore, any information the software spits out (including error messages!) will be kept and can be looked at once you return to your machine from your coffee break.

We can get the logs for each rule to be written to a log file via the `log:` directive:

- It's a good idea to organise the logs by:
  - Putting the logs in a directory labelled after the rule/software that was run
  - Labelling the log files with the sample name the software was run on

- Also make sure you tell the software (fastqc) to write the standard output and standard error to this log file we defined in the `log:` directive in the shell script (eg. `&> {log}`)

```diff
# target OUTPUT files for the whole workflow
rule all:
    input:
        "../results/fastqc/NA24631_1_fastqc.html",
        "../results/fastqc/NA24631_2_fastqc.html",
        "../results/fastqc/NA24631_1_fastqc.zip",
        "../results/fastqc/NA24631_2_fastqc.zip"

# workflow
rule fastqc:
    input:
        R1 = "../../data/NA24631_1.fastq.gz",
        R2 = "../../data/NA24631_2.fastq.gz"
    output:
        html = ["../results/fastqc/NA24631_1_fastqc.html", "../results/fastqc/NA24631_2_fastqc.html"],
        zip = ["../results/fastqc/NA24631_1_fastqc.zip", "../results/fastqc/NA24631_2_fastqc.zip"]
+   log:
+       "logs/fastqc/NA24631.log"
    threads: 2
    envmodules:
        "FastQC/0.11.9"
    shell:
-       "fastqc {input.R1} {input.R2} -o ../results/fastqc/ -t {threads}"
+       "fastqc {input.R1} {input.R2} -o ../results/fastqc/ -t {threads} &> {log}"
```

---

A tangent about [standard streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams)

- These are standard streams in which information is returned by a computer process - in our case the logs that we see returned to us on our screen when we run fastqc
- There are two main streams:
  - standard output (the log messages)
  - standard error (the error messages)

Different ways to write log files:

|  Syntax  | standard output in terminal | standard error in terminal | standard output in file | standard error in file |
|----------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
|   `>`    |  NO                         | YES                        | YES                     | NO                     |
|   `2>`   |  YES                        | NO                         | NO                      | YES                    |
|   `&>`   |  NO                         | NO                         | YES                     | YES                    |

## 3.11 Scale up to analyse all of our samples

We are currently only analysing one of our three samples

Let's scale up to run all of our samples by using [wildcards](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#wildcards), this way we can grab all the samples/files in the `data` directory and analyse them

- Set a global wildcard that defines the samples to be analysed
- Generalise where this rule uses an individual sample (`NA24631`) to use this wildcard `{sample}`
- Use the [expand function](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#the-expand-function) (`expand()`) function to tell snakemake that `{sample}` is what we defined in our global wildcard `SAMPLES,`
- Snakemake can figure out what `{sample}` is in our rule since it's defined in the targets in `rule all:`

```diff
# define samples from data directory using wildcards
+ SAMPLES, = glob_wildcards("../../data/{sample}_1.fastq.gz")

# target OUTPUT files for the whole workflow
rule all:
    input:
-       "../results/fastqc/NA24631_1_fastqc.html",
-       "../results/fastqc/NA24631_2_fastqc.html",
-       "../results/fastqc/NA24631_1_fastqc.zip",

    threads: 2
    envmodules:

    shell:
        "fastqc {input.R1} {input.R2} -o ../results/fastqc/ -t {threads} &> {log}"
```

Visualise workflow

```bash
snakemake --dag | dot -Tpng > dag_2.png
```

Now we have three samples running though our workflow, one of which has already been run in our last run (NA24631) indicated by the dashed lines

My DAG:

{% capture e3dot17 %}

![DAG_2](./images/dag_2.png)

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e3dot17" content=e3dot17%}
<br>

Run workflow again

```bash
# remove output of last run
rm -r ../results/*

# run dryrun again
snakemake --dryrun --cores 2 --use-envmodules
```

See how it now runs over all three of our samples in the output of the dryrun

## 3.12 Add more rules

- Connect the outputs of fastqc to the inputs of multiqc
- Add a new final target for `rule all:`

```diff
# define samples from data directory using wildcards
SAMPLES, = glob_wildcards("../../data/{sample}_1.fastq.gz")

# target OUTPUT files for the whole workflow

Since we haven't defined `{sample}` in `rule all:` for multiqc, we need to define it somewhere! Let do so in the multiqc rule

```diff
# define samples from data directory using wildcards
SAMPLES, = glob_wildcards("../../data/{sample}_1.fastq.gz")

# target OUTPUT files for the whole workflow
rule all:
    input:
        expand("../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.html", sample = SAMPLES),
        expand("../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.html", sample = SAMPLES),
        expand("../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.zip", sample = SAMPLES),
        expand("../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.zip", sample = SAMPLES),
        "../results/multiqc_report.html"

# workflow

        R2 = "../../data/{sample}_2.fastq.gz"
    output:
        html = ["../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.html", "../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.html"],
        zip = ["../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.zip", "../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.zip"]
    log:
        "logs/fastqc/{sample}.log"
    threads: 2
    envmodules:
        "FastQC/0.11.9"
    shell:
        "fastqc {input.R1} {input.R2} -o ../results/fastqc/ -t {threads} &> {log}"
  
rule multiqc:
    input:
-       ["../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.zip", "../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.zip"]
+       expand(["../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.zip", "../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.zip"], sample = SAMPLES)
    output:
        "../results/multiqc_report.html"
    log:

```

Visualise workflow

```bash
snakemake --dag | dot -Tpng > dag_3.png
```

Now we have two rules in our workflow (fastqc and multiqc), we can also see that multiqc isn't run for each sample (since it merges the output of fastqc for all samples)

My DAG:

{% capture e3dot21 %}

![DAG_3](./images/dag_3.png)

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e3dot21" content=e3dot21%}
<br>

Run again

```bash
# remove output of last run
rm -r ../results/*

# run dryrun/run again
snakemake --dryrun --cores 2 --use-envmodules
snakemake --cores 2 --use-envmodules
```

## 3.13 More about Snakemake's lazy behaviour

What happens if we only have the final target file (`../results/multiqc_report.html`) in `rule all:`

```diff
# define samples from data directory using wildcards
SAMPLES, = glob_wildcards("../../data/{sample}_1.fastq.gz")

# target OUTPUT files for the whole workflow
rule all:
    input:
-       expand("../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.html", sample = SAMPLES),
-       expand("../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.html", sample = SAMPLES),
-       expand("../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.zip", sample = SAMPLES),
-       expand("../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.zip", sample = SAMPLES),
        "../results/multiqc_report.html"

# workflow
rule fastqc:
    input:
        R1 = "../../data/{sample}_1.fastq.gz",
        R2 = "../../data/{sample}_2.fastq.gz"
    output:
        html = ["../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.html", "../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.html"],
        zip = ["../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.zip", "../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.zip"]
    log:
        "logs/fastqc/{sample}.log"
    threads: 2
    envmodules:
        "FastQC/0.11.9"
    shell:
        "fastqc {input.R1} {input.R2} -o ../results/fastqc/ -t {threads} &> {log}"
  
rule multiqc:
    input:
        expand(["../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.zip", "../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.zip"], sample = SAMPLES)
    output:
        "../results/multiqc_report.html"
    log:
        "logs/multiqc/multiqc.log"
    envmodules:
        "MultiQC/1.9-gimkl-2020a-Python-3.8.2"
    shell:
        "multiqc {input} -o ../results/ &> {log}"
```

Run workflow again

```bash
# remove output of last run
rm -r ../results/*

# run dryrun again
snakemake --dryrun --cores 2 --use-envmodules
```

It still works because it is the last file in the workflow sequence, Snakemake will do all the steps necessary to get to this target file (therefore it runs both fastqc and multiqc)

Visualise workflow

```bash
snakemake --dag | dot -Tpng > dag_4.png
```

Although the workflow ran the same, the DAG actually changed slightly, now there is only one file target and only the output of multiqc goes to `rule all`

My DAG:

{% capture e3dot22 %}

![DAG_4](./images/dag_4.png)

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e3dot22" content=e3dot22%}
<br>

<p align="center"><b>Beware: Snakemake will also NOT run rules that it doesn't need to run in order to get the target files defined in rule: all</b><br></p>

For example if only our fastqc outputs are defined as the target in `rule: all`

## 3.14 Add even more rules

Let's add the rest of the rules. We want to get to:

![rulegraph_1](./images/rulegraph_1.png)

We currently have fastqc and multiqc, so we still need to add trim_galore

```diff
# define samples from data directory using wildcards
SAMPLES, = glob_wildcards("../../data/{sample}_1.fastq.gz")

# target OUTPUT files for the whole workflow
rule all:
    input:
-       expand("../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.html", sample = SAMPLES),
-       expand("../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.html", sample = SAMPLES),
-       expand("../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.zip", sample = SAMPLES),
-       expand("../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.zip", sample = SAMPLES)
+       "../results/multiqc_report.html",
+       expand(["../results/trimmed/{sample}_1_val_1.fq.gz", "../results/trimmed/{sample}_2_val_2.fq.gz"], sample = SAMPLES)

# workflow
rule fastqc:
    input:
        R1 = "../../data/{sample}_1.fastq.gz",
        R2 = "../../data/{sample}_2.fastq.gz"
    output:
        html = ["../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.html", "../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.html"],
        zip = ["../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.zip", "../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.zip"]
    log:
        "logs/fastqc/{sample}.log"
    threads: 2
    envmodules:
        "FastQC/0.11.9"
    shell:
        "fastqc {input.R1} {input.R2} -o ../results/fastqc/ -t {threads} &> {log}"
  
rule multiqc:
    input:
        expand(["../results/fastqc/{sample}_1_fastqc.zip", "../results/fastqc/{sample}_2_fastqc.zip"], sample = SAMPLES)
    output:
        "../results/multiqc_report.html"
    log:
        "logs/multiqc/multiqc.log"
    envmodules:
        "MultiQC/1.9-gimkl-2020a-Python-3.8.2"
    shell:
        "multiqc {input} -o ../results/ &> {log}"

+ rule trim_galore:
+    input:
+        ["../../data/{sample}_1.fastq.gz", "../../data/{sample}_2.fastq.gz"]
+    output:
+        ["../results/trimmed/{sample}_1_val_1.fq.gz", "../results/trimmed/{sample}_2_val_2.fq.gz"]
+    log:
+        "logs/trim_galore/{sample}.log"
+    envmodules:
+       "TrimGalore/0.6.7-gimkl-2020a-Python-3.8.2-Perl-5.30.1"
+    threads: 2
+    shell:
+        "trim_galore {input} -o ../results/trimmed/ --paired --cores {threads} &> {log}"
```

Visualise workflow

```bash
snakemake --dag | dot -Tpng > dag_6.png
```

Fantastic, we are starting to build a workflow!

My DAG:

{% capture e3dot25 %}

![DAG_6](./images/dag_6.png)

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e3dot25" content=e3dot25%}
<br>

However, when analysing many samples, our DAG can become messy and complicated. Instead, we can create a rulegraph that will let us visualise our workflow without showing every single sample that will run through it

```bash
snakemake --rulegraph | dot -Tpng > rulegraph_1.png
```

My rulegraph:

{% capture e3dot26 %}

![rulegraph_1](./images/rulegraph_1.png)

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e3dot26" content=e3dot26%}
<br>

An aside: another option that will show all your input and output files at each step:

```bash
snakemake --filegraph | dot -Tpng > filegraph.png
```

My filegraph:

{% capture e3dot27%}

![filegraph](./images/filegraph.png)

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e3dot27" content=e3dot27%}
<br>

Run the rest of the workflow

```bash
# run dryrun/run again
snakemake --dryrun --cores 2 --use-envmodules
snakemake --cores 2 --use-envmodules
```

Notice it will run only one rule/sample/file at a time...why is that?

## 3.15 Throw it more cores

Run again allowing Snakemake to use more cores overall `--cores 4` rather than `--cores 2`

```bash
# remove output of last run
rm -r ../results/*

# run dryrun/run again
snakemake --dryrun --cores 4 --use-envmodules
snakemake --cores 4 --use-envmodules
```

Notice the whole workflow ran much faster and several samples/files/rules were running at one time. This is because we set each rule to run with 2 threads. Initially we specified that the *maximum* number of cores to be used by the workflow was 2 with the `--cores 2` flag, meaning only one rule and sample can be run at one time. When we increased the *maximum* number of cores to be used by the workflow to 4 with `--cores 4`, up to 2 samples could be run through at one time.

## 3.16 Throw it even more cores

With a high performance cluster such as [NeSi](https://www.nesi.org.nz/), you can start to REALLY scale up, particularly when you have many samples to analyse or files to process. This is because the number of cores available in a HPC is HUGE compared to a laptop or even an high end server.

<p align="center"><b>Boom! Scalability here we come!</b><br></p>

<p align="center"><img src="nesi_images/mahuika_maui_real.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></p>

To run the workflow on the cluster, we need to ensure that each step is run as a dedicated job in the queuing system of the HPC. On NeSI, the queuing system is managed by [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html).

Use the `--cluster` option to specify the job submission command, using `sbatch` on NeSI.
This command defines resources used for each job (maximum time, memory, number of cores...).
In addition, you need to specify a maximum number of concurrent jobs using `--jobs`.

```bash
# remove output of last run
rm -r ../results/*

# run again on the cluster
snakemake --cluster "sbatch --time 00:10:00 --mem=512MB --cpus-per-task 8 --account nesi99991" --jobs 10 --use-envmodules
```

If you open another terminal on the HPC, you can use the `squeue` command to list of your jobs and their state (pending, running, etc.):

```bash
squeue -u your_nesi_login
```

where `your_nesi_login` needs to be replace with your actual NeSI login.

An additional trick is to use the `watch` command to repeatedly call any command in the terminal, giving you a lightweight monitoring tool ;-).
Here we will use it to see your jobs gets queued and executed in real time:

```bash
watch squeue -u your_nesi_login
```

You can exit the view create by `watch` by pressing CTRL+C.


# Takeaways

---

- Once familiar with environment modules, the software are very straightforward to integrate in your snakemake workflow
- Run your commands directly on the command line before wrapping it up in a Snakemake rule
- First do a dryrun to check the Snakemake structure is set up correctly
- Work iteratively (get each rule working before moving onto the next)
- File paths are relative to the Snakefile
- Run your workflow from where your Snakefile is
- Visualise your workflow by creating a DAG (directed acyclic graph), a rulegraph or filegraph
- Use environment modules to load software in your workflow - this improves reproducibility
- Snakemake is lazy...
  - It will only do something if it hasn't already done it
  - It will pick up where it left off, rather than run the whole workflow again
  - It *won't* do any steps that aren't necessary to get to the target files defined in `rule: all`
- `input:` `output:` `log:` and `threads:` directives need to be called in the `shell` directive
- Capture your log files
- Organise your log files by naming them after the rule that was run and sample that was analysed
- You don't need to specify all the target files in `rule all:`, the final file in a given chain of tasks will suffice
- We can massively speed up our analyses by running our samples in parallel

```bash
SAMPLES, = glob_wildcards("../relative/path/to/samples/{sample}_1.fastq.gz")
```

Combine this with the expand function to tell Snakemake to look at your global wildcard to figure out what you refer to as `{sample}` in your workflow

```bash
expand("../results/{sample}_1.fastq.gz", sample = SAMPLES)
```

Increase the number of samples that can be analysed at one time in your workflow by increasing the maximum number of cores to be used at one time with the `--cores` command

```bash
snakemake --cores 4 --use-envmodules
```
